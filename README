This repository contains my Emacs customizations and configurations. The
current version of the configuration is based on the el-get package manager.

The general structure of directories is :

config/  -- contains all my customizations and configurations
plugins/ -- external packages installed either by el-get or placed manually if
            not found on el-get
plugins/el-get -- Default path for all el-get installs
cache/   -- Temp files
init.el  -- Config starts loading from this file

el-get and all the required pacakages will be installed the first time Emacs is
started with this configuration.

This configuration currently installs the following packages using el-get:
- auto-complete
- auto-complete-latex
- elpy
- icomplete+
- magit
- protobuf-mode
- yasnippet
