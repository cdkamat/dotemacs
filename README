This repository contains my Emacs customizations and configurations. The
current version of the configuration is based on the el-get package manager and
requires Emacs version to be >= 24.3

The general structure of directories is :

config/  -- contains all my customizations and configurations
plugins/ -- external packages installed either by el-get or placed manually if
            not found on el-get
plugins/el-get -- Default path for all el-get installs
cache/   -- Temp files
init.el  -- Config starts loading from this file

el-get and all the required pacakages will be installed the first time Emacs is
started with this configuration. You may need to install version control utilies
like mercurial (hg) and svn since some of the el-get recipes depend on them.

This configuration currently installs the following packages using el-get:
- auto-complete
- auto-complete-latex
- elpy : also requires python side installs as listed at
  https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/wiki/Installation#python-side
- icomplete+
- magit
- protobuf-mode
- yasnippet
