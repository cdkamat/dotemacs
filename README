This repository contains my Emacs customizations and configurations. The
current version of the configuration is based on the el-get package manager.

The general structure of directories is :

config/  -- contains all my customizations and configurations
plugins/ -- external packages installed either by el-get or placed manually if
            not found on el-get
plugins/el-get -- Default path for all el-get installs (this directory needs to
                  be created)
cache/   -- Temp files (This needs to be created)
init.el  -- Config starts loading from this file

el-get will be installed the first time Emacs is started with this
configuration.

For this configuration to work sanely, the following packages must be
installed using el-get :

- magit
- auto-complete
- yasnippet
- icomplete+
- elpy
